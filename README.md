# Practicum-1---Bone-Fracture-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
Our practicum project is on Bone Fracture Detection using Deep Learning. The idea is to use AI to help identify fractures in X-ray images so that doctors can get faster and more reliable results. Weâ€™ll be working with existing datasets of thousands of X-rays and training computer vision models to detect whether a bone is fractured or not.
